Platform description:

Keepnpay is a platform which allows users to convert physical cash to virtual cash and also transfer this cash to any other platform for cashing out or whatever.

Steps involved:
1. Users get to create an account
1a. users get to sign involved

2. The user sees their accounts with all the information involved
2a. The user can carry out transactions or logout


So here are the steps I'd love to take in development:

1. Create Register controller
2. Create Sign in controller
3. Edit Register view
4. Edit Sign-in view
